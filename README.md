# NextAuth Session Undefined in API Routes

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using NextAuth.js within API routes: the session object remains undefined even after a successful login.  The example showcases the problem and its solution.

## Problem

The provided `MyComponent` attempts to access the NextAuth session within an API route. However, due to an incorrect usage of `unstable_getServerSession`, the `session` variable consistently returns `undefined`, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

## Solution

The solution illustrates the correct way to access the session within API routes using the `getServerSession` function and providing the necessary request and response objects correctly.
